# `dotfiles`

nt3rp's dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)

Install them with:

```
chezmoi init nt3rp
```

## Notes

If you are in Windows, there are a few things to consider:

- The easiest way to install `chezmoi` is `winget install twpayne.chezmoi`
- You _may_ need to make some scripts executable via `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- While care has been taken to avoid running as an administrator, you _may_ need to run Powershell as an admin because of how `chezmoi` handles Symlinks in Windows (citation needed)â€”among other reasons
